Translation: no more projects, but a continuous delivery process


Description of innovation
Until now, Continuous Delivery has been addressed as something that translation processes should be aligned with.
But what happens if we start looking at translation projects as a continuous delivery process as well and take all of the learnings from the software industry and apply them to translation? 

Why is this a good/innovative solution 
The notion of 'maximizing the work not done', defining an mvp (minimal viable publication) and relying on user feedback for iterating on it will, just like in software development, minimize the risk and costs and time to market.
